piheater
========
This is a small project I've been working on to control a heater (or really anything) via a Raspberry PI, a powerswitch tail, and 0 or more sensors.  Currently I'm planning on using this for regulating the heating cable for my beer fermenter, and hopefully for a small heater for a wood drying kiln.

DHT code adapted from the following tutorial.
